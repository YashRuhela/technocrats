so i want to create a quiz application in python 
when i execute the code it must go to the folder and check how many files present in the folder
(folder name :- Python Quiz)
let say there are 4 text files present in it; 
and the name of those files is 
Electronics.txt
Physics.txt
Mechanical.txt
Chemistry.txt
so till now we have done that there is a folder named Python Quiz that contains 4 txt files
right;
and we know the names of that files 
now display a menu to the user 
using GUI's
Welcome to Python Quiz #this is a label
#now display the number of buttons how many files are present in that folder 
#for example as i mention above let say there are 4 files present in Python Quiz folder so 
#for this you have to display here 4 buttons and the text on those buttons will be the same as 
#the file name like its says file name is 
#Chemistry.txt so the name in button should be only Chemistry
#so it will be displaying buttons 
Electronics
Physics
Mechanical
Chemistry


#LIKE IF i click Electronics button 
#give a pop up saying electronics button clicked 
#repeat for all buttons

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#LIKE IF i click Electronics button 
#open a new window saying welcome to Electronics Quiz 


/* so files bacically contains multiple choise questions 
* in the format that first line contains questions then 4 options and fifth line contains answer
* like for Electronics file
* Question :- Which Logic gate is used for multiplication operation?
* a) AND gate
* b) NOT gate
* c) X-OR gate
* d) X-NOR gate
* correct option :- a
* and so on (as i mentioned earlier that there are n number of files having n number of question 
**/

#so like you have open the window of Welcome to electronics quiz
now start reading that file like in our case i have considered only electronics file (but keep remember that there are many file on which we are woking on )
suppose you have read the files sarting form Question :- .. to d) X-NOR gate

Question :- Which Logic gate is used for multiplication operation?
a) AND gate
b) NOT gate
c) X-OR gate
d) X-NOR gate
so you have to display this using label 
and a,b,c,d are radio buttons 

maintain next and previous button 


#repeat for all buttons
